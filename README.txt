Instimage yall!
=================

I'm here to demonstrate the glory that is mootools and a little Hpricot.  To run me you need to install ruby and rubygems.  Than it's as simple as:

sudo gem install merb-core
sudo gem install hpricot
cd instimage_dir
merb -I instimage.rb

Than goto localhost:4000 in your webbrowser.  The bulk of the hot js is in instimage/index.html.erb

instimage.pdf is a small set of slides giving an overview of what's happening.

Enjoy
